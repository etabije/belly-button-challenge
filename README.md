Belly Button Challenge

This project builds an interactive data visualization app featuring dynamic bar and bubble charts. 

The bar chart displays the top 10 sample values and utilizes otu_ids for the x-axis labels. Additionally, it shows otu_labels as tooltips when users hover over the bars.

The bubble chart visualizes data with otu_ids represented on the x-axis and as marker colors. It employs sample_values to define the y-axis and the size of each marker, while otu_labels provide descriptive text for each bubble.

The app also includes a metadata section that displays relevant information, updating dynamically when a new sample is selected. Finally, the project is deployed on GitHub Pages, ensuring easy access for users.
